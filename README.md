# Immunie, the frontend project.

Prepared with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Immunie](https://immunie.net/) team.

### Briefing

The basic user story is:

A simple task, we need you to clone one of ours pages

> https://immunie.net/products/people

For this test you are allowed to copy all assets from the page. üëç

Here's the mandatory frontend stack that must play a major role in your implementation:

- React;
- MaterialUI;
- Typescript

_Hint_: the translation system is not a requirement, but if you implement it consider i18next;

The project should be deployed at Vercel or Netlify and you should send a link for the github project to: rh.passeverde@immunie.net

### Extra features

Nobody it's expecting it. üíÖ But it will be nice to see:

- Automatically change website language based on the visitor country;
- NextJS is a big plus;
- automated tests of any kind.

Just don't overengineer it too much. Keep it simple.

### Points of interest

It all depends of the level of seniority you're applying to, of course. But our main observations are:

- general computing knowledge;
- your approach to problems;
- how you're architecting the JSX components, state tree, file modules;
- basic (again, _basic_) UX details like:
  - responsive UI,
  - reactive state machine letting the user know what's happening all the time,
  - acessiblity issues;
- care with resource leaks;
- consistent programming paradigm usage;
- modern and idiomatic JavaScript;
- good patterns of React;
- thinking twice before introducing a new dependency;
- experience with RESTful APIs consumption; and
- good usage of MaterialUI or any other adjacent CSS tool, like Sass preprocessor or Styled Components.

Feel free to use any boilerplate, but consider we'll be using Node 12, `npm i` and `npm start` for testing (also `npm test` in case you write tests).

And we don't care about Internet Explorer that much.

Be cool and happy coding!
